# Intern-day-7
"On Day 7 of my internship, I started working on a basic website. This project includes a homepage and multiple linked pages, featuring a structured layout using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. It focuses on responsive design and user-friendly navigation. Future improvements may include interactive elements and backend integration."
